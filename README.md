# Random Chat App

This is my first project using Python, Flask, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and Jitsi. The app allows users to meet random people on video calls. Users log in with their email ID, click a chat button, and if another user is available, they are matched and a Jitsi room is created for the video call.

## Features

- User login with email
- Random matching for video chat
- Jitsi integration for video calls
- MySQL database to manage user sessions and matches

  ## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishalkaushikdixit/random-chat-app.git
   cd random-chat-app/Flask
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 main.py
    ```
Make sure to create the database and tables before running the app. Use the commands in database file to set up your database.
